Compiles curl (and dependencies - zlib, openssl ) for Android

## Prerequisites

Linux

And also necessary `autoconf` and `libtool` toolchains.

## Download

If you do not want to compile them yourself, you can download pre-compiled static libraries from [releases](https://github.com/Zackptg5/openssl-curl-android/releases). They are in `build.tar.gz`.

Doing your own compilation is recommended, since the pre-compiled binary can become outdated soon.

Update git submodules to compile newer versions of the libraries:
```
cd submodule_directory
git checkout LATEST_STABLE_TAG
cd ..
```

## Usage

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/Zackptg5/openssl-curl-android.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Edit build.sh script:
NDK=android_ndk_version_you_want_to_use
export HOST_TAG=see_this_table_for_info # https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/other_build_systems#overview
export MIN_SDK_VERSION=21 # or any version you want (dependent on the ndk version - keep 21 if in doubt)
```
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```
All compiled libs are located in `build` directory.

## Options

Change scripts' configure arguments to meet your requirements.

For now, using tls (https) in Android would throw `peer verification failed`.

If using libcurl, explicitly set `curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, CA_BUNDLE_PATH);` where `CA_BUNDLE_PATH` is your ca-bundle in the device storage.
If using curl binary, change the --with-ca-bundle flag in build-curl.sh to the path/name of the cacert file you'll be placing

You can download and copy [cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) to the internal storage to get tls working for libcurl.

## Working Example

Checkout this [repo](https://github.com/robertying/CampusNet-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/cpp/jni) to see how to integrate compiled static libraries into an existing Android project, including `Android.mk` setup and `JNI` configurations.
